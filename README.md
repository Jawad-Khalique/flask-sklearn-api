ðŸ§  Flask + scikit-learn API: Iris Classifier (Deployed on AWS EC2)
This project is a simple Flask API that serves a machine learning model built using scikit-learn. The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset and predicts the species of iris flower based on sepal and petal measurements.

It also demonstrates how to:

Containerize a Python ML API using Flask

Deploy it on an AWS EC2 instance

Access the API through a public IP
